#Third, Star Wars, the Command Line, and The Battle for the Fate of the Universe

Working in the command line is a key skill to develop as a programmer. It's a big break from what you're used to, and practice makes (eventually) perfect. Let's explore the Star Wars narrative using the command line!

Please record your commands underneath each bullet point in this markdown.

As you work, make sure you `git add .` and `git commit -m "[YOUR MESSAGE HERE]"`!

## "A New Hope"
### Act I

* In your unit01/w00_d01/homework directory, create a new directory called `star_wars`.

> Example answer: `mkdir star_wars`

* In the `star_wars` folder, create two new directories: `empire` and `rebellion`.
> paste your command here

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `darth_vader`.
> paste your command here

* Use the force (or your knowledge of the command line) to add the text "...heavy breathing..." to the `darth_vader` file. (Don't remember how to do this? Use the `other force`, known as Google!)
> paste your command here

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a .txt file called `emperor_palpatine`.
> paste your command here

* Inside the `empire` directory, create a directory called `death_star`.
> paste your command here

* Move `darth_vader` into the `death_star`.
> paste your command here

### Act II

* Move back to your `star_wars` directory, and enter the `rebellion` directory.
> paste your command here

* Create a file called `princess_leia` and add the text "Help me, Obi-Wan...You're my only hope."
> paste your command here

* Create a file called `obi_wan`.
> paste your command here

* Create a file called `luke_skywalker`.
> paste your command here

* Create a directory called `millenium_falcon`.
> paste your command here

* Inside the `millenium_falcon`, create two files: `han_solo` and `chewy`.
> paste your command here

* Move `luke_skywalker`, `obi_wan`, and `princess_leia` into the `millenium_falcon`.
> paste your command here

* Move the `millenium_falcon` into the `death_star`.
> paste your command here

### Act III

* Unload the Millenium Falcon! Move the whole crew from the `millenium_falcon` directory into the `death_star` directory.
> paste your command here

* `darth_vader` has defeated `obi_wan`! Delete poor `obi_wan`.
> paste your command here

* Our heroes have disabled the tractor beam! Move the whole crew back into the `millenium_falcon`! Remember: `darth_vader` remains in the `death_star` and `emperor_palpatine` is still in the `empire`.
> paste your command here

* Move the `millenium_falcon` back into the `rebellion` directory.
> paste your command here

* `darth_vader` leaves the `death_star` to pursue Luke! Move him from the `death_star` into the `empire` directory!
> paste your command here

* Thanks to his practice back home at Beggar's Canyon, Luke blew up the `death_star`! Remove it from the galaxy!
> paste your command here
